Dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles for setting up and configuring my environment.

### Requirements

**[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** &amp; **[Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads)**

> `sudo` is necessary for Homebrew to be installed and for some others. To get started run these commands:

```bash
# Clone from Github
$ github clone https://github.com/rossedman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# run bootstrap!
sh ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh

# run full install!
sh ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh

# run update
sh ~/.dotfiles/update.sh

# run only a specific file
sh ~/.dotfiles/init/.homestead
```
